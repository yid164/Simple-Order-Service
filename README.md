### Gathering Requirements: 

1. RESTful (I might consider using node.js with Exress Framework)

2. Inventory entity (Name, Description, Price, Quantity)

3. Order entity (Customer email address, Data order placed, Order status)

4. In my understand, the question is focusing on backend (RESTful)

### Possible Solutions:

1. Node.js with Express framework 

2. Using MongoDB as backend database (Because it is free)

3. Using Postman to test APIs 

4. Because the question does not require authorization, which means I do not need to do the username, password and verfiy them.

5. Extra tool: maybe morgan, body-parse, mongoose for implementation
